This is my front end of my burger builder app which I created doing a udemy course. The backend was originally with Firebase but I created a new backend with Express and Mongo DB and have hosted it on Heroku. Firebase returns objects from the database and Mongo DB returns arrays of objects, so I had to refactor alot of the front end to handle the change in data type coming back from the datbase. 

I also added Javascript Web Tokens for authentication on the front and back end which was my first time using them. This was a good experience and I also stored them in local storage so the user will be logged into the app for 1 hour even if they leave.
